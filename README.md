# React Space News Flight ðŸš€

This is a React project which allows us to be up to date with the spaceflight news, as blogs, reports and even articles! âœ¨

In order to achieve this goal, the app consumes the Spaceflight News API and offers all the information you are going to find on the website!

### Here as the technologies used:

- TypeScript;
- React;
- Tailwind CSS.

Before going under the project itself, I created a prototype with the basic and initial layout using Figma ðŸ˜‰

The website is deployed on Netlify and the URL is https://react-space-flights-news.netlify.app;

## Getting started locally:

1. Add a .env file in your root project and create a environment variable there like this: VITE_BASE_URL={API's base URL};

- You can find the base URL here: https://api.spaceflightnewsapi.net/v4/docs/;

2. Run the project with the command line: `npm run dev`.

I hope you have fun! :)
